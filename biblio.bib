	title = {The interface in demixed colloid-polymer systems - {Wetting}, waves and droplets},
	isbn = {978-90-393-3484-3},
	abstract = {This thesis reports on a study of the behaviour and properties of interfaces with an ultralow interfacial tension. In the first chapter it is explained that an ultralow interfacial tension has several important consequences both for the statics and dynamics of interfaces. The system becomes intrinsically slow and for the dynamics life at ultralow interfacial tension is similar to life at low Reynolds number. This makes the study relevant from a fundamental point of view. The experimental systems are colloid-polymer mixtures, which are used for example in the food industry. Similar mixtures are present in the living cell as well. This gives the present study industrial as well as biological relevance.In chapter 2 the model colloid-polymer mixtures are introduced. Furthermore, the experimental setup is described, which consists of a horizontally placed microscope used either in the transmission or in the laser scanning confocal mode.The observations of the phase behaviour of the first experimental system inspired the theory presented in chapter 3. Here, we extend the free volume theory for mixtures of hard sphere colloids and ideal polymers to include curvature effects and polymer-polymer interactions. The theoretical model of chapter 3 is extended further to calculate the interfacial tension and the wetting behaviour (chapter 4). The interacting polymer model lowers the gas-liquid interfacial tension and predicts the wetting transition to occur at higher polymer concentrations as compared to the ideal polymer model. In chapter 5 we experimentally study the gas-liquid interface in the vicinity of a vertical hard wall. The interfacial profile is accurately described by the interplay between the Laplace and the hydrostatic pressure. From this description the capillary length is obtained, which is at most tens of microns and in qualitative agreement with theory. Furthermore, it turns out that the system shows complete wetting for all statepoints measured. In chapter 6 we show how to tune length- and timescales in such a way that the fluctuating fluid-fluid interface can be seen directly in real space with a resolution close to the particle size. Experimental results for static and dynamic correlation functions validate the capillary wave model down to almost the particle level. We are able to obtain the ultra-low interfacial tension, the capillary length and the capillary time, which are found to be in agreement with independent measurements. It turns out that capillary waves play a crucial role in droplet coalescence (chapter 7). The coalescence is a three step process: (i) drainage of the continuous film between droplet and bulk phase, (ii) breakup of the film, and (iii) the growth of the connection. We observe that drainage becomes very slow and eventually the breakup of the film is induced by thermal capillary waves. The waiting time for a certain height fluctuation can be directly obtained from experiment. During the third stage the radius of the connecting neck grows linearly with time with a velocity in good agreement with the capillary velocity. The thermal roughness is also important in droplet snap-off processes. In chapter 8 we study the possibility of observing a regime where thermal noise dominates over interfacial tension. In a system with an ultralow interfacial tension the symmetry and appearance of the snap-off event suggests that thermal noise becomes dominant. In the final chapter, chapter 9, we are able to follow the phase separation process in great detail due to the ultralow interfacial tension. Simple scaling arguments are given why in experiment three steps of the phase separation can be observed: an interfacial tension driven coarsening, gravity driven flow, and finally the interface formation. All these stages can be observed in a single experiment.},

	abstract = {The present work investigates the effect of interfacial fluctuations (predominantly capillary wave-like fluctuations) on the solvation free energy (Δμ) of a monatomic solute at the water–vapor interface. We introduce a grand-canonical-ensemble-based simulation approach that quantifies the contribution of interfacial fluctuations to Δμ. This approach is used to understand how the above contribution depends on the strength of dispersive and electrostatic solute-water interactions at the temperature of 400 K. At this temperature, we observe that interfacial fluctuations do play a role in the variation of Δμ with the strength of the electrostatic solute–water interaction. We also use grand canonical simulations to further investigate how interfacial fluctuations affect the propensity of the solute toward the water–vapor interface. To this end, we track a quantity called the interface potential (surface excess free energy) with the number of water molecules. With increasing number of water molecules, the liquid–vapor interface moves across a solute, which is kept at a fixed position in the simulation. Hence, the dependence of the interface potential on the number of waters models the process of moving the solute through the water–vapor interface. We analyze the change of the interface potential with the number of water molecules to explain that solute-induced changes in the interfacial fluctuations, like the pinning of capillary-wave-like undulations, do not play any role in the propensity of solutes toward water–vapor interfaces. The above analysis also shows that the dampening of interfacial fluctuations accompanies the adsorption of any solute at the liquid–vapor interface, irrespective of the chemical nature of the solute and solvent. However, such a correlation does not imply that dampening of fluctuations causes adsorption.},

We demonstrate that, at short times, the dynamics of all these models is unexpectedly described by an effective continuum theory in which transverse fluctuations, i.e., fluctuations averaged along the drive, are Gaussian, irrespective of this being actually the case in the stationary state. Strong numerical evidence is provided, in remarkable agreement with that theory, both for the driven and undriven lattice gases, which therefore turn out to display the same short-time dynamics.},

	abstract = {Critical properties of a liquid film between two planar walls are investigated in the canonical ensemble, within which the total number of fluid particles, rather than their chemical potential, is kept constant. The effect of this constraint is analyzed within mean-field theory (MFT) based on a Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional as well as via Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model with fixed total magnetization. Within MFT and for finite adsorption strengths at the walls, the thermodynamic properties of the film in the canonical ensemble can be mapped exactly onto a grand canonical ensemble in which the corresponding chemical potential plays the role of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint. However, due to a nonintegrable divergence of the mean-field order parameter profile near a wall, the limit of infinitely strong adsorption turns out to be not well-defined within MFT, because it would necessarily violate the constraint. The critical Casimir force (CCF) acting on the two planar walls of the film is generally found to behave differently in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. For instance, the canonical CCF in the presence of equal preferential adsorption at the two walls is found to have the opposite sign and a slower decay behavior as a function of the film thickness compared to its grand canonical counterpart. We derive the stress tensor in the canonical ensemble and find that it has the same expression as in the grand canonical case, but with the chemical potential playing the role of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint. The different behavior of the CCF in the two ensembles is rationalized within MFT by showing that, for a prescribed value of the thermodynamic control parameter of the film, i.e., density or chemical potential, the film pressures are identical in the two ensembles, while the corresponding bulk pressures are not.},

Both the limiting form and the correction are predicted to be functions that are characteristic of the Ising universality class and are independently known. The theory is tested with extensive Monte Carlo studies of the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid, within the grand canonical ensemble. The simulations and scaling framework together are shown to provide a powerful way of identifying the location of the liquid-gas critical point, while confirming and clarifying its essentially Ising character. The simulations also show a clearly identifiable signature of the field-mixing responsible for the failure of the law of rectilinear diameter.},

	abstract = {Near the critical point the characteristic time of motion associated with certain degrees of freedom experiences an enormous slowing-down. This circumstance gives rise to a possibility of constructing a kinetic equation to describe such slowed-down motions of the system, which corresponds to the Boltzmann equation of dilute gases which describes slow variations of the single-particle distribution function. We accomplish the derivation of kinetic equations with the aid of a generalized Langevin equation due to Mori. The theory is illustrated by deriving kinetic equations obeyed by critical fluctuations in isotropic and planar Heisenberg ferromagnets, an isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet, the liquid helium near the λ point, and a binary critical mixture. The kinetic equations conform to the dynamical scaling whenever it holds, and are valid in the hydrodynamic as well as in the critical regimes. The kinetic equations are then used to obtain selfconsistent closed equations to determine time correlation functions of critical fluctuations. In particular, in the case of a binary critical mixture, the selfconsistent equation can be used to obtain the diffusion constant and the decay rate of concentration fluctuation in the critical regime, which are expressed in terms of shear viscosity, and the results are in good numerical agreement with those of the recent light scattering experiments. The theory also leads to the modification of the Fixman correction [1 + (qκ)2] to [1 + (35)(qκ)2] when q ⪡ k where q and k are the wavenumber and inverse correlation range of the concentration fluctuation, respectively.},

The corresponding stochastic equations for the density of the electrolyte species are solved by linearizing them about the mean density of ionic species, yielding an effective Gaussian theory. The non-equilibrium density–density correlation functions are computed and the conductivity of the electrolyte is deduced. In the bulk, our results give a simple derivation of the results of Onsager and coworkers who used very different methods. The method developed here can also be used to study electrolytes confined in one and two dimensions and interacting via either the three dimensional Coulomb interaction or the Coulomb interaction corresponding to that dimension of space.},

The renormalization group is then developed in some detail, and applied to a variety of systems. The main dynamic universality classes are identified and characterized. It is found that the mode-coupling and renormalization group theories successfully explain available experimental data at the critical point of pure fluids, and binary mixtures, and at many magnetic phase transitions, but that a number of discrepancies exist with data at the superfluid transition of 4He.},

	abstract = {The Airy distribution function describes the probability distribution of the area under a Brownian excursion over a unit interval. Surprisingly, this function has appeared in a number of seemingly unrelated problems, mostly in computer science and graph theory. In this paper, we show that this distribution function also appears in a rather well studied physical system, namely the fluctuating interfaces. We present an exact solution for the distribution P(hm,L) of the maximal height hm (measured with respect to the average spatial height) in the steady state of a fluctuating interface in a one dimensional system of size L with both periodic and free boundary conditions. For the periodic case, we show that P(hm,L)=L−1/2f(hmL−1/2) for all L{\textgreater}0 where the function f(x) is the Airy distribution function. This result is valid for both the Edwards–Wilkinson (EW) and the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang interfaces. For the free boundary case, the same scaling holds P(hm,L)=L−1/2F(hmL−1/2), but the scaling function F(x) is different from that of the periodic case. We compute this scaling function explicitly for the EW interface and call it the F-Airy distribution function. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical results. Our results provide a rather rare exactly solvable case for the distribution of extremum of a set of strongly correlated random variables. Some of these results were announced in a recent Letter [S.N. Majumdar and A. Comtet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92: 225501 (2004)].},

The steady-state force is also analyzed for systems which have nonequilibrium steady states, for instance, where they are driven by colored noise. The key to the method is that the out of equilibrium force is computed by specifying an energy of interaction between the field and the surfaces in the problem. In general, we find that there is a mapping of the dynamical problem onto a corresponding static one and in the case where the latter can be solved, the full dynamical behavior of the force can be extracted. The method is used to compute the nonequilibrium Casimir force induced between two parallel plates by a fluctuating field, in the cases of Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Various other examples, such as the fluctuation-induced force between inclusions in fluctuating media, are discussed.},

The transition to transverse order is governed by a fixed point which is infrared stable below five dimensions. With the help of Ward-Takahashi identities based on Galilei invariance, we derive scaling forms for density correlation functions, critical exponents to all orders in ε=5−d, and the equation of state, taking care of a dangerous irrelevant composite operator. The transition is continuous and of mean-field type, with anomalous long-wavelength and long-time correlations in the longitudinal direction only. For the transition to longitudinal order, no infrared stable fixed point is found. An analysis of the mean-field equations indicates that the transition is discontinuous.},

Field theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo estimates for the critical exponent values do not seem to agree with each other. In this paper we introduce a Langevin equation in which the effects of the microscopic dynamics are carefully taken into account. We show that the order parameter critical exponent when the drive is infinite (no backwards jumps) is not mean-field-like, in contrast with the prediction for finite values of the drive. This finding seems to reconcile field theoretical and numerical results.},

	abstract = {The accurate estimation of the excess free energy due to an interface between coexisting phases of a model system by computer simulation often is a challenging task. We review here two methods, which rely on constructing paths between a system containing a ‘slab’ of one phase separated by two planar interfaces from the other phase, and a system (with the same total volume) without interfaces. Studying such a system with a slab geometry, it is natural to choose a rectangular geometry (in dimensions), where is the direction perpendicular to the interfaces, and periodic boundary conditions are applied throughout. Since interfaces exhibit large-scale fluctuations, a careful analysis of finite-size effects is mandatory. In the ensemble switch method, an intermediate Hamiltonian is constructed, adding the Hamiltonian of a system with interfaces, multiplied by a fraction , to an equivalent system without interfaces, with fraction . Adding to the state variables of the system, a thermodynamic integration from to yields the desired interfacial free energy. While intermediate states (with ) lack immediate physical meaning, the alternative method discussed here relies on sampling the probability distribution , where is a suitable physical order parameter distinguishing the phases. Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed, using Ising models, Lennard-Jones fluids and the solid-to-liquid transition of the hard sphere model as examples.},

Data analysis techniques are also explained starting with straightforward measurement and error-estimation techniques and progressing to topics such as the single and multiple histogram methods and finite size scaling. The last few chapters of the book are devoted to implementation issues, including discussions of such topics as lattice representations, efficient implementation of data structures, multispin coding, parallelization of Monte Carlo algorithms, and random number generation. At the end of the book the authors give a number of example programmes demonstrating the applications of these techniques to a variety of well-known models.},

How can one determine the growth laws that describe the time dependence of characteristic length scales, and what can be said about the form of the associated scaling functions? Particular attention will be paid to systems described by more complicated order parameters than the simple scalars usually considered, for example vector and tensor fields. The latter are needed, for example, to describe phase ordering in nematic liquid crystals, on which there have been a number of recent experiments. The study of topological defects (domain walls, vortices, strings and monopoles) provides a unifying framework for discussing coarsening in these different systems.},

To this purpose, a blocking procedure is applied, using the block size as a variable cutoff, and a translationally invariant method to determine the interface position of strongly fluctuating profiles on small length scales is introduced. While the capillary wave picture is confirmed on large length scales and its limit of validity is estimated, an intrinsic regime is, contrary to expectations, not observed.},

	abstract = {We show that the error variance contributed by random uncorrelated measurement noise can be merged with the error variance contributed by real variations in the atmosphere to obtain a single expression for the total error variance when the sampling time is much less than the integral scale of atmospheric variability. We assume that the measured signal is a representation of a variable that is continuous on the scale of interest in the atmosphere. The characteristics of this noise are similar, but not identical, to quantization noise, whose properties are briefly described. Uncorrelated noise affects the autocovariance function (or, equivalently, the structure function) only between zero and the first lag, while its effect is smeared across the entire power spectrum. For this reason, quantities such as variance dissipation may be more conveniently estimated from the structure function than from the spectrum. The modeling results are confirmed by artificially modifying a test time series with Poisson noise and comparing the statistics from ten realizations of the modified series with the predicted error variances. We also demonstrate applications of these results to measurements of aerosol concentrations. A “figure of merit” is defined which is used to specify when instrument counting noise contributes more to measurement error than does atmospheric variability. For example, for measuring the vertical flux of a trace species for a small surface resistance to deposition, the specified counting rate is about 100 counts s−1 for measuring flux in the surface layer and about 103 counts s−1 for measuring flux throughout the convective boundary layer.},

	abstract = {The equilibration of Ising systems in random magnetic fields at low temperatures (T) following a quench from high T is studied in the framework of a simple solid-on-solid model. The rate at which ordered domains in the model grow with time in any dimension (d) is estimated as a function of the random-field strength, the exchange strength, and T, on the basis of an approximate analogy to the problem of a one-dimensional random walk in a random medium. Domains are argued to grow logarithmically with time for all d. This result has a simple interpretation in terms of energy barriers which must be surmounted in the equilibration process.},

	abstract = {A transfer-matrix-scaling technique is developed for randomly diluted systems, and applied to the site-diluted Ising model on a square lattice in two dimensions. For each allowed disorder configuration between two adjacent columns, the contribution of the respective transfer matrix to the decay of correlations is considered only as far as the ratio of its two largest eigenvalues, allowing an economical calculation of a configuration-averaged correlation length. Standard phenomenological-renormalization procedures are then used to analyze aspects of the phase boundary which are difficult to assess accurately by alternative methods. For magnetic site concentration p close to pc, the extent of exponential behavior of the Tc×p curve is clearly seen for over two decades of variation of p-pc. Close to the pure-system limit, the exactly known reduced slope is reproduced to a very good approximation, though with nonmonotonic convergence. The averaged correlation lengths are inserted into the exponent-amplitude relationship predicted by conformal invariance to hold at criticality. The resulting exponent η remains near the pure value (1/4) for all intermediate concentrations until it crosses over to the percolation value at the threshold.},

All methods yield a surface tension which is positive at sufficiently low temperature for small random fields, h, provided that the dimensionality d{\textgreater}2. The lower critical dimension of the RFIM is thus argued to be 2. While effects due to discreteness of a lattice are argued to alter some of the continuum results quantitatively, they do not change these central conclusions.

	abstract = {This is the second in a series of three papers that charts the history of the Lenz–Ising model (commonly called just the Ising model in the physics literature) in considerable detail, from its invention in the early 1920s to its recognition as an important tool in the study of phase transitions by the late 1960s. By focusing on the development in physicists’ perception of the model’s ability to yield physical insight—in contrast to the more technical perspective in previous historical accounts, for example, Brush (Rev Modern Phys 39: 883–893, 1967) and Hoddeson et al. (Out of the Crystal Maze. Chapters from the History of Solid-State Physics. Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 489–616, 1992)—the series aims to cover and explain in depth why this model went from relative obscurity to a prominent position in modern physics, and to examine the consequences of this change. In the present paper, which is self-contained, I deal with the development from the early 1950s to the 1960s and document that this period witnessed a major change in the perception of the model: In the 1950s it was not in the cards that the model was to become a pivotal tool of theoretical physics in the following decade. In fact, I show, based upon recollections and research papers, that many of the physicists in the 1950s interested in understanding phase transitions saw the model as irrelevant for this endeavor because it oversimplifies the nature of the microscopic constituents of the physical systems exhibiting phase transitions. However, one group, Cyril Domb’s in London, held a more positive view during this decade. To bring out the basis for their view, I analyze in detail their motivation and work. In the last part of the paper I document that the model was seen as much more physically relevant in the early 1960s and examine the development that led to this change in perception. I argue that the main factor behind the change was the realization of the surprising and striking agreement between aspects of the model, notably its critical behavior, and empirical features of the physical phenomena.},

	abstract = {.I chart the considerable changes in the status and conception of the Lenz-Ising model from 1920 to 1950 in terms of three phases: In the early 1920s, Lenz and Ising introduced the model in the field of ferromagnetism. Based on an exact derivation, Ising concluded that it is incapable of displaying ferromagnetic behavior, a result he erroneously extended to three dimensions. In the next phase, Lenz and Ising’s contemporaries rejected the model as a representation of ferromagnetic materials because of its conflict with the new quantum mechanics. In the third phase, from the early 1930s to the early 1940s, the model was revived as a model of cooperative phenomena. I provide more detail on this history than the earlier accounts of Brush (1967) and Hoddeson, Schubert, Heims, and Baym (1992) and question some of their conclusions. Moreover, my account differs from these in its focus on the development of the model in its capacity as a model. It examines three aspects of this development: (1) the attitudes on the degree of physical realism of the Lenz-Ising model in its representation of physical phenomena; (2) the various reasons for studying and using it; and (3) the effect of the change in its theoretical basis during the transition from the old to the new quantum mechanics. A major theme of my study is that even though the Lenz-Ising model is not fully realistic, it is more useful than more realistic models because of its mathematical tractability. I argue that this point of view, important for the modern conception of the model, is novel and that its emergence, while perhaps not a consequence of its study, is coincident with the third phase of its development.},

Nous abordons ensuite le cas ou la dynamique est forcée par une contrainte extérieure. Cette situation est importante en vue des applications (rhéologie des liquides surfondus et des fluides complexes, compaction lente des matériaux granulaires, etc.), et son étude systématique est un des aspects nouveaux de ce travail. Dans ce cadre, nous étudions tout d'abord numériquement l'influence d'un écoulement sur la séparation de phase d'un mélange binaire.

A. Rikvold and M. Kolesik, J. Stat. Phys. 100, 377 (2000)], and by dynamic Monte Carlo simulations. The probability density of the height of an individual step in the surface is obtained, both analytically and by simulation. The width of the probability density is found to increase dramatically with the magnitude of the applied field, with close agreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results. Excellent agreement between theory and simulations is also found for the field dependence and anisotropy of the interface velocity. The joint distribution of nearest-neighbor step heights is obtained by simulation. It shows increasing correlations with increasing field, similar to the skewness observed in other examples of growing surfaces.},

We solve the model in the sense that we compute the precise asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the model. In particular, we obtain a formula for the free energy and show that the model exhibits a phase transition, in fact a localization/delocalization transition. We focus in particular on the critical behavior, that is on the behavior of the system close to the phase transition. The approach is then generalized to a general class of Markov chain pinning, which is more naturally introduced in terms of (discrete) renewal processes. We complete the chapter by introducing the crucial notion of correlation length and by giving an overview of the applications of pinning models. Ising models are presented at this stage because pinning systems appear naturally as limits of two dimensional Ising models with suitably chosen interaction potentials. In spite of the fact that these lecture notes may be read focusing exclusively on pinning, the physical literature on disordered systems and Ising models cannot be easily disentangled. So a full appreciation of some physical arguments/discussions in these notes does require being acquainted with Ising models.},

The model is found to exhibit two phases where the interface is pinned to the central ring: one in which it fluctuates symmetrically around the central ring and another where it fluctuates asymmetrically. In addition, we find a phase where the interface is centered in the bulk of the system, either below or above the central ring of the cylinder. In the latter case, the symmetry breaking is ‘stronger’ than that found in equilibrium when considering a repulsive potential on the central ring.

The same unexpected scenario, and a precise location of the associated tricritical point, are obtained for a simplified hierarchical model.

We propose an explanation for the different temperature dependences of the coercive field for repulsive and attractive pinning potential when the pinning boundary forms an array of pyramids and suggest that the switching dynamics are different in the two regimes. This may be tested experimentally by magnetic viscosity measurements on samples with different Cu contents. We also found analytically that when the pinning boundary forms an array of cubes, the coercive field always decreases no matter whether the pinning potential is repulsive or attractive. This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.},

We use the transfer integral technique to write down the pseudo-Schrödinger equation for the model, which allows us to obtain some analytical insight, and to compute numerically the free energy from the exact transfer operator. We compare the results with Monte Carlo simulations of the model, finding a perfect agreement between both procedures. We thus establish that the model shows a phase transition between a low-temperature flat phase with intriguing nontrivial properties and a high-temperature rough one. The fact that the model is one-dimensional and that it has a true phase transition makes it an ideal framework for further studies of roughening phase transitions.},

	abstract = {When a magnetic Ising film is confined in a L×M geometry (L⪡M) short-range competing magnetic fields (h1) are applied at opposite walls along the M-direction, a (weakly rounded) localization–delocalization transition of the interface between domains of different orientation that runs parallel to walls can be observed. This transition is the precursor of a wetting phase transition that occurs in the limit of infinite film thickness (L→∞) at the critical curve Tw(h1). For T{\textless}Tw(h1)(T{\textgreater}Tw(h1)) such an interface is bound to (unbound from) the walls, while right at Tw(h1) the interface is freely fluctuating around the center of the film. We present extensive Monte Carlo simulations of Ising stripes in the L×M geometry, in order to describe both the localization–delocalization transition and the properties of the delocalized interface. To this aim, we take advantage of several available theoretical results. We make use of a suitable algorithm to define the local position of the interface along the film, such that its probability distribution can be used to account for the transition itself and the fluctuations in the local position of the interface (capillary waves). After describing the interface localization–delocalization transition, we pay attention to the properties of the delocalized interface with an emphasis on the effects of confinement. We analyze several quantities of interest in terms of the film thickness L. The width of the capillary waves (s) can be related to the width of the magnetization profiles (w) by means of a simple approximation. From this relation we estimate a value for the intrinsic width (w0) of the interface which agrees with the theoretical one. Also the correlation length ξ∥ along the film is considered, and the behavior ξ∥∼L2 compares very well to available exact results. Additionally, the interfacial stiffness βΓ obtained from the Fourier spectrum of the capillary waves reproduces the asymptotic theoretical value.},

The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences.},

	abstract = {A modification of the perturbation theory of a symmetrical anharmonic oscillator is suggested. A more complex zero-order approximation of perturbation theory that considers to a certain degree anharmonicities is chosen rather than a harmonic oscillator model. This approximation is an analog of the self-consistent field model well known in the theory of many-particle systems. A comparison of modified and conventional perturbation theories demonstrates that the modified perturbation theory has much wider applicability range. It can be used for larger values of the parameters at which the conventional perturbation theory becomes inapplicable, namely, for strong anharmonicity and upper energy levels.},

In particular, we study the imaginary part of the constrained free-energy branch that corresponds to the metastable phase. Although droplets are not introduced explicitly, the metastable free energy is obtained in excellent agreement with field-theoretical droplet-model predictions. The finite-size scaling properties are different in the weak-field and intermediate-field regimes, and we identify the corresponding different critical-droplet shapes. For intermediate fields, we show that the surface free energy of the critical droplet is given by a Wuff construction with the equilibrium surface tension. We also find a prefactor exponent in complete agreement with the field-theoretical droplet model. Our results extend the region of validity for known results of this field-theoretical droplet model, and they indicate that this transfer-matrix approach provides a nonperturbative numerical continuation of the equilibrium free energy into the metastable phase.},

	abstract = {We discuss the relation of the excess specific heat, the excess energy per area, and the thermodynamic Casimir force in thin films. A priori these quantities depend on the reduced temperature t and the thickness L0 of the film. However finite-size scaling theory predicts that the scaling functions h′′(x), h′(x), and θ(x) of these quantities depend only on the combination x=t[L0/ξ0]1/ν, where ν is the critical exponent and ξ0 the amplitude of the correlation length. Furthermore, the finite-size scaling function θ(x) of the thermodynamic Casimir force per area can be expressed in terms of the scaling functions h′(x) and h(x) of the excess energy per area and the excess free energy per area. Here we study this relation at the example of thin films of the improved two-component ϕ4 model on the simple cubic lattice. Note that this model undergoes a second-order phase transition that belongs to the three-dimensional XY universality class. First we simulate films with periodic boundary conditions in the short direction and a thickness up to L0=13 lattice spacings. We find that even for these rather thin films, the predictions of finite-size scaling are well satisfied. We repeat the analysis for films with free boundary conditions. To this end we use Monte Carlo data for the energy per area obtained in previous work. It turns our that corrections to scaling caused by the boundary conditions are very prominent in this case. Only by taking into account these corrections we are able to obtain θ(x) from the excess energy. Finally we repeat this exercise using experimental data for the excess specific heat of 4He films near the λ transition. The finite-size scaling behavior of the excess specific heat is governed by h′′(x), which is proportional to the scaling function f2 discussed in the literature.},

In this paper we extend the WRMC algorithm to a general control variate technique and exhibit the optimal choice of the control variate in terms of the asymptotic variance. We also give an example which shows that, in contradiction to the intuition of physicists, the WRMC algorithm can have an asymptotic variance larger than that of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. However, in the particular case of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm called the Boltzmann algorithm, we prove that the WRMC algorithm is asymptotically better than the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. This last property is also true for the multi-proposal Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. In this last framework we consider a linear parametric generalization of WRMC, and we propose an estimator of the explicit optimal parameter using the proposals.},

In particular, if trial moves to a potential target state are rejected, that state is not included in the sampling. I will argue that the efficiency of effectively all Markov Chain MC schemes can be improved by including the rejected states in the sampling procedure. Such an approach requires only a trivial (and cheap) extension of existing programs. I will demonstrate that the approach leads to improved estimates of the energy of a system and that it leads to better estimates of free-energy landscapes.},

	abstract = {Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for studying the equilibrium properties of matter. In complex condensed-phase systems, however, it is difficult to design Monte Carlo moves with high acceptance probabilities that also rapidly sample uncorrelated configurations. Here, we introduce a new class of moves based on nonequilibrium dynamics: Candidate configurations are generated through a finite-time process in which a system is actively driven out of equilibrium, and accepted with criteria that preserve the equilibrium distribution. The acceptance rule is similar to the Metropolis acceptance probability, but related to the nonequilibrium work rather than the instantaneous energy difference. Our method is applicable to sampling from both a single thermodynamic state or a mixture of thermodynamic states, and allows both coordinates and thermodynamic parameters to be driven in nonequilibrium proposals. Whereas generating finite-time switching trajectories incurs an additional cost, driving some degrees of freedom while allowing others to evolve naturally can lead to large enhancements in acceptance probabilities, greatly reducing structural correlation times. Using nonequilibrium driven processes vastly expands the repertoire of useful Monte Carlo proposals in simulations of dense solvated systems.},

The global roughness scales with the film thickness t as W ∼ t β /[ R 3/2 ( ϵ + a )], where β ≈ 0.2 is the growth exponent consistent with Villain–Lai–Das Sarma (VLDS) scaling and a = 0.025. This general dependence on R and ϵ is inferred from renormalization studies and shows a remarkable effect of the former but a small effect of the latter, for ϵ ⩽ 0.1. For R ⩾ 10 4 , very smooth surfaces are always produced. The local roughness shows apparent anomalous scaling for very low temperatures ( R ⩽ 10 2 ), which is a consequence of large scaling corrections to asymptotic normal scaling. The scaling variable R 3/2 ( ϵ + a ) also represents the temperature effects in the scaling of the correlation length and appears in the dynamic scaling relation of the local roughness, which gives dynamic exponent z ≈ 3.3 also consistent with the VLDS class.},

The exact solution manifold for the CSOS models is therefore a 3-dimensional manifold in a much larger thermodynamic space. The free energy, local height probabilities, and general order parameters are calculated exactly and the associated critical behavior examined. The critical exponents are found to be α = 2 − Ls, βj = j2s(L − s), βj = (2j − L)24s(L − s). The phase diagram exhibits L regimes of 2(L − s)-fold coexistence which coalesce at a multicritical point given by p = 0. The order parameters possess jump discontinuities at the regime boundaries although there is no barrier to analytic continuation. For L = 3 and s = 2, our results extend Baxter's results on the three colorings of the square lattice.},

Near T R , the roughening transition temperature, the results are in good agreement with other estimates of gamma . The method is then applied to growth of (110) faces of naphthalene for melt and solution. They find that gamma does not depend on the temperature, in contrast to gamma found for the SOS model. The (110) face of naphthalene hence does not behave according to the infinite-order roughening transition of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The classical method to model crystal growth from solution with SOS models turns out to be fundamentally incapable to describe surface roughening in the naphthalene case.},

This article shows that a few groups in the US, Britain, Italy and the Netherlands developed technologies that enabled the construction of the new clock in 1927–28. To coordinate complex and large communication networks, the monopolistic American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and national laboratories needed to determine and maintain a common ‘standard’ frequency measurement unit. Exploiting novel piezoelectric quartz methods and valve electronics techniques, researchers in these organizations constructed a new crystal-based frequency standard. To ensure its accuracy they compared it to an accepted absolute standard an astronomical clock, constructing thereby the ﬁrst quartz clock. Other groups, however, had different, though connected, technological aims, which originated from the diverse interests of the industrial, governmental and academic institutes to which they belonged, and for which they needed to measure, control and manipulate with frequencies of electric oscillations. The present article suggests a comparative examination of the research and development paths of these groups on their incentives, the technological and scientiﬁc resources they utilized, and the kind of research carried out in the various institutional settings.},

The problem of deﬁning relevant topic-categories is addressed, both direct and indirect strategies being employed to ensure that the topics correspond to what the editors and publishers took to be the principal areas of science and technology of interest to their readers. Analysis of the results of the surveys reveals different editorial policies depending on the backgrounds of the publishers and their anticipated readerships. The strong focus of the two most populist magazines on applied science and ‘hobbyist’ topics such as natural history, radio and motoring is noted and contrasted with the very limited coverage of theoretical science. In conclusion, a survey of changes in the contents over the periods of publication is used to identify trends in the coverage of science during this period.},

The work of physicists such as Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, among others, was pivotal to the so-called planetary model of the atom, which, still today, is used in popular accounts and in science textbooks. In an attempt to add to our knowledge about the popular trajectory of the new atomic physics, this paper examines one book in particular, co-authored by Danish science writer Helge Holst and Dutch physicist and close collaborator of Niels Bohr, Hendrik A. Kramers. Translated from Danish into four European languages, the book not only explained contemporary ideas about the quantum atom, but also discussed unresolved problems. Moreover, the book was quite explicit in identifying the quantum atom with the atom as described by Bohr’s theory. We argue that Kramers and Holst’s book, along with other ‘atomic books’, was a useful tool for physicists and science popularisers in trying to understand the new quantum physics.},

To address this problem in the case of nonconserved dynamics, we study an anisotropic version of the Burgers equation, constructed to describe thermal fluctuations of an interface in the presence of a uniform shear flow. As a result, we find that stretched domains are only marginally stable against thermal fluctuations in d=2, whereas they are stable in d=3.},

The interface is stabilized by two parallel walls with opposing surface fields, and a driving field parallel to the walls is applied which (i) either acts locally at the walls or (ii) varies linearly with distance across the strip. Using computer simulations with Kawasaki dynamics, we find that the system reaches a steady state in which the magnetization profile is the same as that in equilibrium, but with a rescaled length implying a reduction of the interfacial width. An analogous effect was recently observed in sheared phase-separated colloidal dispersions. Pair correlation functions along the interface decay more rapidly with distance under drive than in equilibrium and for cases of weak drive, can be rescaled to the equilibrium result.},

It is concluded that it may be thermodynamically profitable for the surface to be 'saw-toothed' rather than flat, the extra entropy associated with such an arrangement compensating for the additional surface energy. For both a two- and a three-dimensional ' saw-tooth' the extra entropy varies, to a first approximation, in the same way as the surface energy, i.e. is proportional to Ni or N\$ respectively, where N is the number of molecules in a 'tooth'. For the simple cubic lattice, the entropy associated with the formation of a tooth containing N atoms is estimated to be 3-3fcNt. It is also possible to estimate the variation of the 'equilibrium roughness' of a crystal with temperature, if its surface energy is known.},

For each of them, we review the estimates of the critical exponents, of the equation of state, of several amplitude ratios, and of the two-point function of the order parameter. We report results in three and two dimensions. We discuss the crossover phenomena that are observed in this class of systems. In particular, we review the field-theoretical and numerical studies of systems with medium-range interactions. Moreover, we consider several examples of magnetic and structural phase transitions, which are described by more complex Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonians, such as \$N\$-component systems with cubic anisotropy, O(\$N\$)-symmetric systems in the presence of quenched disorder, frustrated spin systems with noncollinear or canted order, and finally, a class of systems described by the tetragonal Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with three quartic couplings. The results for the tetragonal Hamiltonian are original, in particular we present the six-loop perturbative series for the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-functions. Finally, we consider a Hamiltonian with symmetry \$O(n\_1){\textbackslash}oplus O(n\_2)\$ that is relevant for the description of multicritical phenomena.},

	abstract = {Kinetic interfaces form the basis of a fascinating, interdisciplinary branch of statistical mechanics. Diverse stochastic growth processes can be unified via an intriguing nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation whose consequences and generalizations have mobilized a sizeable community of physicists concerned with a statistical description of kinetically roughened surfaces. Substantial analytical, experimental and numerical effort has already been expended. Despite impressive successes, however, there remain many open questions, with much richness and subtlety still to be revealed. In this review, we give an unorthodox account of this rapidly growing field, concentrating on two main lines - the interface growth equations themselves, and their directed polymer counterparts. We emphasize the intrinsic links among the topics discussed, as well as the relationships to other branches of natural science. Our aim is to persuade the reader that multidisciplinary statistical mechanics can be challenging, enjoyable pursuit of surprising depth.},

Although the statistics is Gaussian at low shear, we observe a transition to a nonlinear phenomenology above a critical shear rate. In particular, we show that statistical properties at high forcing share striking similarities with Burgers turbulence. An energy criterion allows us to predict the onset of nonGaussian statistics. It also provides a simple explanation for the development of shock singularities through the exchange of kinetic energy from regions with positive to negative gradients in the shear direction.},

This is realized in binary liquid mixtures close to their consolute point Tc which belong to the universality class of the Ising model. The deviation of the diﬀerence of the chemical potentials of the two species of the mixture from its value at criticality corresponds to the bulk magnetic ﬁled of the Ising model. By using Monte Carlo simulations for this latter representative of the corresponding universality class we compute the critical Casimir force as a function of the bulk ordering ﬁeld at the critical temperature T = Tc. We use a coupling parameter scheme for the computation of the underlying free energy diﬀerences and an energy-magnetization integration method for computing the bulk free energy density which is a necessary ingredient. By taking into account ﬁnite-size corrections, for various types of boundary conditions we determine the universal Casimir force scaling function as a function of the scaling variable associated with the bulk ﬁeld. Our numerical data are compared with analytic results obtained from mean-ﬁeld theory.},
